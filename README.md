# Simple-Desktop-Flashbang
A lightweight program that can, either randomly or with twitch integration, create a flashbang effect on your screen.

### To Use The Program
To use, go to the link below and press authorize when asked.
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=4ocquuv1wpfordfq04za5l7anqch0e&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000&scope=channel%3Aread%3Aredemptions&state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671

Afterwards copy the access token (after '#access-token=' and before the next '&') from the URL you are redirected to.
ex: http://localhost:3000/#access_token= **1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrst**&scope=
### For Developers
You will need your own API Access Token to get the program to hook to the API.
